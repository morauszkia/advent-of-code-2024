# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my [**Advent of Code 2024**](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) repository! This repository contains a set of 25 coding challenges, each organized into its own folder. Each challenge is structured with a problem description, (typically) a Python solution, and an input file.

For more information about the Advent of Code and the challenges for the year 2024, visit [the official website](https://adventofcode.com)!
Challenges for the previous years can be found under [the Events page](https://adventofcode.com/events).

## üèÜ Challenges

Each day (D1 to D25) presents a new coding challenge. The problems may involve algorithms, data structures, or other programming concepts.

## üöÄ Running the Solutions

To run a solution for a specific day's challenge:

1. Navigate to the challenge folder, e.g., `D1`.
2. Ensure `input.txt` contains the required input data. Input data is different for everyone, so if you want to solve your own challenge, please replace the contents with your input data.
3. Run the Python script (ensure you have Python installed on your computer):

```bash
python solution.py
```

## üìÇ Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders by day:
